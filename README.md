# Project-Data-Analys-4
In this project, I worked with a large dataset containing 5000 rows and 27 columns to perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). One of the key challenges was handling approximately 1500 missing values, which required strategic imputation and data integrity checks.

# Student Performance Analysis Project

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze student performance based on various factors, including stress levels, sleep hours, study hours, parent education, family income, extracurricular activities, and department-wise academic results. The goal is to identify key patterns and insights that can help understand how these variables impact students' total scores.

## Dataset Used
The dataset contains 5,000 records, ensuring diverse student performance insights.

## Question
This project aims to answer the following key questions:
- How does stress level affect student performance?
- Is there a correlation between sleep hours, study hours, and total score?
- Do students with extracurricular activities perform better than those without?
- How does parent education and family income impact student grades?
- Which department has the highest and lowest pass rate?
- What is the grade distribution among students?

## Process
- Data Cleaning and Preparation
  1. Checked for missing values and inconsistencies.
  2. Standardized categorical data (e.g., Parent Education levels, Departments).
  3. Converted numerical data into appropriate formats.
  
- Data Analysis Techniques
  1. Used Microsoft Excel for data preprocessing and statistical analysis.
  2. Calculated averages, and distributions to understand relationships between variables.
  
- Visualization Tool
Google Looker Studio â€“ Used for interactive dashboard creation and data visualization.

## Project Insight
- Stress Level and Performance
  Higher stress does not always correlate with lower performance; moderate stress levels seem optimal.
- Sleep and Study Hours Impact
  More study hours generally lead to higher scores, but excessive studying with minimal sleep reduces effectiveness.
- Parent Education and Income Influence
  Higher parental education and income do not guarantee higher student performance.
- Extracurricular Participation
  Students in extracurricular activities score slightly higher on average.
- Departemental Performance
  CS and Engineering have the highest student count, while Mathematics has the highest fail rate.

## Final Conclusion
- Balanced study habits (study time & sleep) are crucial for optimal performance.
- Stress affects student performance but in a nonlinear way (moderate stress is ideal).
- Extracurricular participation has a slight positive effect on total scores.
- Parental education and income have a mixed impact, indicating other factors at play.
- Departments show varying pass/fail rates, suggesting differences in difficulty level.

This analysis provides valuable insights into how students can optimize their academic performance. Future research can incorporate additional factors like teaching methods, mental health support, and classroom engagement for deeper analysis.

# Project-Data-Analys-4
In this project, I worked with a large dataset containing 5000 rows and 27 columns to perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). One of the key challenges was handling approximately 1500 missing values, which required strategic imputation and data integrity checks.

# Student Performance Analysis Project

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze student performance based on various factors, including stress levels, sleep hours, study hours, parent education, family income, extracurricular activities, and department-wise academic results. The goal is to identify key patterns and insights that can help understand how these variables impact students' total scores.

## Dataset Used
The dataset contains 5,000 records, ensuring diverse student performance insights.
